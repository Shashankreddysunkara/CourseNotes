* Cncf
* Lf eve

* EdgeXFoundry

* Balena 
OS. uses Moby for scheduling

* Akri. 
So, it seems that Akri is less about managing edge Kubernetes clusters, and more about using Kubernetes as a conduit, and data plane for accessing remote devices such as GPUs and IP cameras.

* K3. 
Low powered kubernetes K3s can provide similar capabilities to EVE through other CNCF and cloud native projects, and, when built as part of a complete architecture, can resemble a complete system more like EdgeX Foundry. We chose K3s as the core of this course for its flexibility and suitability to constrained devices. It also offers a very low barrier to entry for learning and experimentation.
