4 nodes has 2^6 networks

Walk..any path between nodes
Path any walk that does not repeat nodes
Geodsic . Shortest path between nodes

Diameter -> How close are nodes to each other..
	largest geodesic (largest shortest path.. in general between any 2 nodes)
	if unconnected, of largest component
	
	e.g. circular network diameter is n/2 or (n-1)/2 (depending on odd or even)
		Tree node => 2log2(n+1) (Diameter is distance from bottem corner on left to bottem corer on right.. thats why we multiply by 2)
		In general K levels deep.
			diameter is 2K where K = log2(n+1)

	Average path length.. is another measure.. less prone to outliers
	
	Neighbourhood Ni(g) = Pj|ij in g}
	
	Degree of node i = #Ni(g).. Number of connecting nodes to Node i in network g. e.g. highest degree = node with max number of connections
	
	higher degree  means network is more than likely connected
	d(n) [degree] >= (1+epsilon)log(n) for some epsilon>0... d= number of connections
		links are dense enough so network is almost surely connected
	
	d(n)/n -> 0 network is not too complete (ie. lots of nodes not connected to each other .. typical of a large network)
	
	Theorem on network structure
		if d(n) >= (1+epsilon)log(n) for some epsilon>0 and d(n)/n -> 0 
		Then for large n average path length and diameter are approx proportional to 
			log(n)/log(d)
		also
		
			avgDist(n)/(log(n)/log(d(n))) -> 1 ... same for diameter
			
			or log(n)/log(d) tends to the average distance or diameter
	
	Intuition on theorem
		Cayley tree.. Each node besides leaves has degree d (leaf nodes only have one connetion up)
			e.g.
				step 1 tree... reach d nodes
				step 2 d (d-1).. Note (d-1 since actually has d connections, but we have already included the root node)
				step 3 d (d-1) (d -1) = d(d-1)^2
				
				
			Cayley Tree with d=3, after two steps. How many nodes in total are there after 3 steps)? 
				= 3(2^2) = 12  (12 nodes after 3 steps)
				+ 3(2) = 6   (6 nodes after 2 steps)
				+ 3    (3 nodes after 1st step)
				+1 (root node)
				=22
				Rougly this is (d-1) ^ m (steps) for large m
				this is d+d(d-1)+ d(d-1)^(m-1) nodes
				 = d
				
				log(22)/log(3) =  2.8136
				
				
	Erdos number. .Erdos did original paper on random network
		Erdos write 1400 papers and has 509 co-authors

		
		
	Example of network degree (densite = average degree)
		Facbook 120 (average number of friends = d)
		Highschool friendships = 6.5
		Highschool Romances =0.8
		
		World
			n = 6.7 billion (world population)
			• d = 50 (friends, relatives...)
			• log(n)/log(d) is about 6 !!
			
	Degree Distribution, How degree varies accross RANDOM network .. .G(n,p):
		• probability that node has d links is binomial
		[ (n-1)! / (d!(n-d-1)!) ] p^d (1-p)^(n-d-1)
		 = (n choose d)
		• Large n, small p, this is approximately a Poisson distribution:
		[ (n-1)^d / d! ] p^d e^-(n-1)p
		• hence name ``Poisson random graphs’’
		
	Fat tail is more represetations at high value and low value.. not distributed along expected curve exactly
		so log(freq) vs log(deg) is often linear
		
	romance network doesn't have fat tails.. curve is less linear.. fits expected better.
	
		e.g. 5 has 3 friends.. but only one pair of them are firends of each other => 1/3
		
						
	Centrality Measures
		Centrality,
			Four different things to measure:
			• Degree – connectedness.. but can be high degree node is still on periphery. This doesn't capture that
			• Closeness, .. (n-1) / SUMj( len(i,j)) .. ie. number of nodes divided by sum of distances to other nodes
			Decay – ease of reaching other nodes 
			• Betweenness – role as an intermediary, connector
			• Influence, Prestige, Eigenvectors –
			``not what you know, but who you know..’’
	
	Clustering
		e.g. What fraction of my friends are friends of each other
		cl(g) = # frieds who are firends / #friends... (do it over pairs of friends)
		
Growing networks
	Lots of matural networks have high clustering so not at all like random networks.#Can sumulate this by creating high level of clustering and then addnig some random links.
	`
		e.g. 5 has 3 friends.. but only one pair of them are firends of each other => 1/3	
		Difference in clustering.. Average could tend to 1 as # friends increase
			but friends are grouped.. Overall tends to 0
	
	Homophily
		Birds of a feather flock together
			e.g. interracial marriages (1% of whites.. 5% blacks... 14% asians).. Not what we'd expect for uniform or random..
				closest friend 10% men name a woman.. 32% of women name a man

	
	
	Closeness
	
	Betweeness.. Measure if it is an intermediary.
	
	For Question in homework
from	   1  2  3  4  5  6  7    how often is this node on geodesics?
		1. -  2  0  3  1  0  1
		2. 0  -  0  3  1  0  1
		3. 0  4  -  3  5  0  1
		4. 0  4  0  -  1  0  1
		5. 0  4  0  3  1  -  0  
		6. 0  2  0  3  1  -  0
		7. 0  2  0  3  1  0  -
Totals     0 18  0 18 11  0  4.. so max betweenness is nodes 2 and 4


Fandom networks
	Adding nodes.
		THi forms natural hetrroenity whihc matches many natural networks (i.e older nodes have more links than newer nodes)
		Each new node has m links (assume only new links added to new nodes)
		As each node gets added the degree of existing nodes changes
		Probability  => m+m/(t+1)+m/(t+2) + .. tn
		For node i born at time m<i<t (i.e. after start (m) and before end time t)
		THis approximates to m(1+ln(t/i))   plots to log curve (like reverse J)
		
		so say m=20 and t = 100. What probability is there that nodes have degree<35
			Expected degree = 20(1+ln(100/i)< 35
			=> 20ln(100/i) < 15  => 100/i < e(3/4) => i> 100 e-(3/4)  => i> 47.2
			So Probability is (100-47.2) / 100 => 62.8% that nodes have >35 degre		
		
		
		Preferential node forming
			Previous models don't have fat tails as before (i.e. more links than expected for random network	
			
			Probability of attaching to i is di(t)/2tm
			
			Distribution of Expected Degrees
			• ddi(t)/dt = m(di(t)/2tm) and di(i)=m
			• ddi(t)/dt = mdi(t)/2tm = di(t)/2t and di(i)=m
			• di(t) = m (t/i)1/2
			
			Form links with probablilty.. 
				e.g. Rich get richer
				"Rich get richer", i.e. links are formed with probability proportional to number of links a node already has
				
			Consider a Preferential attachment model described in the lecture, with m=10 and t=50.
				What is the fraction of "nodes with degree < 20", F50(20)?
					eqn = di(t) = m (t/i)^.5
					di(t) = di(50) => 20 > 10 (50/i)^.5.. Nodew with degree 20 or less. so 20 > di(t)
					4> 50/i =>    i > 12.5
					
					50-12.5/50
					
			Consider the "Preferential Attachment Model" described in lecture 3.3, with m=10.
				At date t=30, what are:
				(1) the expected degree for node 12 (born at time i=12), and
				(2) the expected degree for node 25 (born at time i=25)?
				[Hint: Use the approximation for the expected degree at time t of a node born at time i from the lecture which is m(t/i)0.5. You are encouraged to compare the results here to those in Question 1.]
				
					eqn = di(t) = m (t/i)^.5
					  10.sqrt(30/12)
					  
				Power links  can be modelled by preferential attachemnt. 'Very fat tails'
					  
	HYbrid model
		di(t) = (m + 2am/(1-a))(t/i)(1-a)/2 - 2am/(1-a)
			At date t=10,000, consider a node born at date i=20 and a node born at date i=9999, with m=10. Let us compare the cases of a=0.8 and a=0.2.
			
				di(t) = 10+2.(0.8).10/
